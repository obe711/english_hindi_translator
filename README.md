Starter source code and test scripts for the Raspberry Pi interpreter walk-i-talkies.

Best to use with a headless device. I used the Strech Raspian Lite from a NOOBZ install on the two I built.

I'll make full version available soon, after I clean up the code. Full version connects two Raspberry Pi 3B+ on boot
then detects your language through either a light weight onboard DB or web API. Devices can connect through bluetooth 
or any shared wireless network. Fully operational OFF LINE in case internet is unavailable or weak.

For less than $70 you'll be able to have a face to face conversations in over 100 languages or better yet, your
girlfriend's mom that doesn't speak english, thus making you the boyfriend (or girlfriend) of the year.
